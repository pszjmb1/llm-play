# LLM-Play

Welcome to **LLM-Play**, an open-source collaborative gym designed to explore, benchmark, and evolve the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through reinforcement learning environments.

## What is LLM-Play?

**LLM-Play** empowers researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to submit and test novel reinforcement learning challenges tailored to language models. Inspired by [Andrej Karpathy's vision](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1884676486713737258), our mission is to construct a diverse gym of RL environments that reveal the hidden cognitive strategies of LLMs.
