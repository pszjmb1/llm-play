title: LLM-Play Roadmap

# Roadmap

We have an evolving roadmap with both short-term and long-term goals. A detailed roadmap is coming soon!


## Short Term

- Enhance the UI for submitting and testing environments.
- Integrate additional LLM APIs for broader benchmarking. Modularize API integration to support scalability.
   + Start with:
      * OpenAI
      * Anthropic
      * Cohere APIs
- First “Hello World” [Tutorial](./tutorials.md):
   + A minimal RL challenge (like a simple text-based navigation task) will help onboard new contributors. Make this prominent in the ./CONTRIBUTING.md.      
   + Correct any coming soon messages or links to it
- Refine community voting and result analysis features.
- GitHub Wiki for Technical Documentation:
    Use [the Wiki](https://github.com/pszjmb1/llm-play/wiki) for in-depth technical documentation like API references, database schema explanations, or detailed developer guides.
    Link the Wiki from your GitHub Pages site under a "Developer Docs" section.

## Long Term

- Develop advanced analytics dashboards.
- Implement voting systems, challenge ratings, and user leaderboards to gamify contributions.
   + Eventually host community events, hackathons, and webinars.
- Expand the platform to support more complex multi-agent and adaptive learning challenges.
   + Introduce environments where multiple LLMs interact or compete, highlighting emergent behaviors.
